""" FIND PEAK ELEMENT

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
