# Maude
Maude is a formal reasoning tool, and hence sets out to solve a different set of problems than most imperative languages. The goal is often to use Maude to verify that things are "as they should", and show us why not, if this is the case. Maude lets us define formally what we mean by some concept, without concidering implementation details of the consept, and how things in the program is internally represented.

The Maude system is a high-level langague supporting executable specification and declarative programming in rewriting logic. Since rewriting logic contains equaltional logic, Maude also supports equational specification and programming in its sublanguage of functional modules and theories. The underlying equational logic choses for Maude is membership equation logic, that has sorts, subsorts, operatior overlading, and partiality definable by membership and equality conditions.

My experience using Maude comes from the university course IN2100 (Logic for system analysis) from the University of Oslo, were we used Maude to learn concepts from equational, temporal and rewriting logic. I recommend you checking out the course if you find any of this interesting.
